          <h2>High school </h2>
          <hr>
          <p>High school typically refers to the educational stage attended by students aged
            approximately 14 to 18 years old, preceding tertiary education (college or university). It serves as a crucial
            period for academic, personal, and social development, where students undertake
            a standardized curriculum that includes core subjects such as mathematics, science,
            language arts, and social studies. Additionally, students may choose elective courses
            based on their interests and career aspirations.
            High school aims to prepare students for higher education or the workforce
            by providing a broad academic foundation and essential life skills.
            Beyond academics, high school offers opportunities for extracurricular 
            activities, including sports, clubs, and community service, which contribute
            to students' personal growth and well-roundedness. It's also a time for
            adolescents to explore their identities, form friendships, and develop important social skills.
            Throughout high school, students may face various challenges,
            including academic pressures, social dynamics, and decisions 
            about their future paths. Guidance counselors, teachers, 
            and supportive peers often play critical roles in helping 
            students navigate these challenges and make informed decisions about their academic and personal futures.</p>
